# HitchBot
This is an implementation of [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) using [Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai/) to interact with tinder's users in a natural way. Stop spending time just in boring introductory conversations! (Hi, how are you?, what do you do?, etc.)

There's no API available for Tinder Service, we are going to base our development in other open sourced project that has implemented.
We don't have intention to promote any kind of bad behavior with this project, we just want to try it with few real people.

*The name of this project is a reference to the American movie "Hitch" (2005) where Will Smith is a professional dating consultant* ;)

## Project Objectives
The go of this project is to show case the power of these tools and how conversational bots can be used in different scenarios, including informal and casual conversations, using customized connections to 3rd party applications.

This is a proof of concept (PoC) using Tinder, but the ultimate goal is to be integrated with any 3rd party dating platform.

"[Mi Media Manzana](http://mimediamanzana.com/)" is a potential ISV who can integrate this solution into their current platform. Mi Media Manzana is the Latin America's 1st online dating website based in a compatibility matchmaking algorithm, available in Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. They offer two levels of subscriptions (free/basic and paid/premium) and they are always looking for new capabilities/features to add value to their premium customers. They currently have an internal chat system for bot basic and premium users, so HitchBot could be a very interesting brand-new added value for their premium customers.

*This project is part of an Internal Virtual Hackathon at Microsoft Latin America. [Learn more here!](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=8670662A0687C238&resid=8670662A0687C238%21502285&authkey=APOAyIccmpONDQw&em=2)*
