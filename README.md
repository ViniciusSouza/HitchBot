# TinderBot
This is a implementation of [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/), using [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/) (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) to interact with tinder's users.

There's no API available for Tinder Service, we are going to base our development in other open sourced project that has implemented.
We don't have intention to promote any kind of bad behavior with this project, we just want to try it with real people.

## Project Objectives
The go of this project is to show case the power of this tool and how this technology can be used in busineses scenarios where we can use the bot for the first level of attendance.

This project is part of a Microsoft Virtual Hackathon for LATAM.
